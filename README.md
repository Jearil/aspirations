# aspirations

The code for my personal blog, Aspirations of a Software Developer. This is a continuation of the original wordpress site at developeraspirations.wordpress.com. Now in Jekyll!

Note to self: Deploying is done in WSL while compiling is done in PowerShell. I wish I were just running Linux but my main machine is also mainly for games and WSL had issues with jekyll for some reason.

Second note to self: Update the site to auto publish on git push. That way we don't have to do any of this stuff.
