I used to attempt to learn a new langauge (programming) every year. I fell out of the habit around 2011 or so, and to an extent I lament that. I learned Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, Python, and a few others just to get a feel for those languages. I ended up using Scala and Python in a work environment, but most of the time it was just to think differently about my main programming languages. It also kept me interested and excited for programming.

Part of doing game development for me (which has stalled, but I'll get back to it), has been learning the new environments and languages. I've played with C# in the past, but not to any great extent. Using Godot, I get to practice C# a lot more and learn more of that. I use Protocol Buffers every day at work, but a lot of it is already set up and generating. Starting from scratch was a great thing to better understand how that works as well. I wanted to start learninga gain to gain more passion for programming so I decided to take a course offered by my job. That course is [Comprehensive Rust](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/).

I'd like to share just a few of my learnings and take-aways from that experience.

I'll update this post with those experiences, but for now, I completely overhauled my computer and I'm posting this early just to make sure my new setup works.
