I used to have a blog about 15 years ago on [Wordpress](http://developeraspirations.wordpress.com). I'm not a huge fan of Wordpress, though it did get the job done. I later moved to [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and hosted myself on AWS. However, that was difficult to maintain and the upgrade process and DB setup leaved a bit to be desired.

Recently, I thought about blogging again. And thinking about it, why should a blog even have a database? It seems like overkill for what is basically serving up static pages right? So I could just make static pages and add in links. Though that's a little tedious, it's also super cheap to host static content. To avoid the tedium, I've decided to rebuild this site in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it's been an ok learning experience. I don't have automatic publishing set on commits yet, but it will happen at some point I'm sure.

I took a lot of design inspiration from various sites, but mostly from one. I'll post a link here when I find it again. **\[Update\]:** The design inspiration came from [Xe Iaso](https://xeiaso.net)

I have a few thoughts to publish, starting with a post about using commits as a productivity metric, but hopefully I can just start writing here again about anything dealing with programming. I've been interested more and more in gamedev so maybe I'll chroicle some learnings about that here as well.

That's it for my introductory post. I'll add a comment section in later when I remember how that works again.

\[Update\] I figured out comments. \
\[Update 2\] I found the link and ammended it above.
